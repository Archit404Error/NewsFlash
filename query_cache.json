In fact, there\u2019s now a mass exodus of women from Kamala Harris' own staff. As Politico put it, \"Harris\u2019 team is experiencing low morale, porous lines of communication and diminished trust among aides and senior officials.\" In other words, because Kamala Harris\u2019 father came from the Caribbean, it\u2019s ok that she\u2019s a monster to work for. First, Kamala Harris takes control of a task she doesn\u2019t understand. Kamala Harris may be one of the least impressive people in public life, but on some days it seems like she\u2019s running our country anyway. They tell us is that media storyline -- Joe Biden\u2019s fine; he\u2019s just got a really bad stutter, so relax -- isn't actually convincing anyone. Outside of this channel, no one on television is allowed to say what seems obvious, which is that Biden can\u2019t really do his job. Joe Rogan doesn\u2019t work on television, he hosts a podcast, so he can say whatever he wants, and recently he did:\n\nJOE ROGAN: We\u2019re unhinged, in a lot of ways, and we\u2019re not anchored down by a real leader. You can say Joe Biden is the president, he\u2019s our leader, and you\u2019d be correct on paper but, I mean, everybody knows he\u2019s out of his mind. We don\u2019t say a lot about Biden\u2019s decline on this show, because it\u2019s depressing, and because our default position is always to respect old people, especially when they get a little soft, as we all will if we live long enough, so it\u2019s bad karma to mock them for it."], "abc-news": ["No article found", ""], "breitbart-news": ["Biden Picks University President Who Paid Him $900,000 As Ambassador", " The NLPC announcement read:\n\nSince 2017 alone, when the Biden Center opened and after Joe Biden announced he was running for President in April 2018, the university received over $70 million from China, of which $22 million were listed as \u201cAnonymous.\u201d Federal law requires the disclosure of the source of all donations over $250,000."], "axios": ["No article found", ""], "the-hill": ["No article found", ""], "the-washington-post": ["No article found", ""]}, {"bbc-news": "center", "cnn": "liberal", "fox-news": "conservative", "abc-news": "liberal", "breitbart-news": "conservative", "axios": "center", "the-hill": "center", "the-washington-post": "liberal"}, {"bbc-news": null, "cnn": null, "fox-news": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-nobody-thinks-joe-biden-actually-runs-the-white-house", "abc-news": null, "breitbart-news": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/07/03/joe-biden-picks-university-president-who-paid-him-900000-as-ambassador-to-germany/", "axios": null, "the-hill": null, "the-washington-post": null}, 9, 1625357120.3186328, [["negative", 0.650239], ["negative", 0.735196], ["negative", 0.844076], ["negative", 0.662398], ["positive", 0.591925], ["negative", 0.662398], ["negative", 0.665727], ["negative", 0.65449]]], ["North Korea", ["bbc-news", "cnn", "fox-news", "abc-news", "breitbart-news", "axios", "the-hill", "the-washington-post"], {"bbc-news": ["Kim Jong-un: North Korea sees 'grave incident\u2019 after Covid lapses", " North Korea has put in place strict restrictions and state media have continually exhorted citizens to be vigilant against the virus, even warning them late last year to be wary of \"yellow dust\" from China."], "cnn": ["No article found", ""], "fox-news": ["No article found", ""], "abc-news": ["EXPLAINER: How bad is the pandemic in North Korea?", " A look at some of the clues:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEXPERTS DIVIDED OVER EPIDEMIC\n\nDu Hyeogn Cha, an analyst at Seoul\u2019s Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said the North could be dealing with a huge COVID-19 outbreak that has spread beyond border towns and rural areas and is now reaching urban centers, possibly including capital Pyongyang.
