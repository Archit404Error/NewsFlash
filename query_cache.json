Google stopped selling the Pixel 4 and the Pixel 4 XL from its own store in August 2020, but they're still available from retail partners until supplies last. While this program can get you free repairs if you're in one of the eligible regions, it only covers specific power-related issues.\n\nIn particular, the issues must be related to not being able to switch on your phone and to having trouble charging with an adapter or a wireless charger. If your phone keeps restarting or shutting down without you doing it or if your battery drains significantly faster than before, you could get free repair under the program, as well. In Canada, Japan and Taiwan, you could even get a free replacement. That said, you can't get a free repair or replacement if you purchased your device from Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy Spain or the UK, even if you're in one of the eligible locations.\n\nMake sure to check Google's FAQ page for more information on how you can take advantage of the program in your location.
