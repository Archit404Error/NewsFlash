The Nintendo Switch OLED model is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 a Switch with an upgraded OLED display \u2014 but it also brings a number of other promising upgrades to Nintendo\u2019s hybrid games console.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED is launching on Oct. 8 for $349, with preorders set to open soon. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the new system, and how it stacks up to the existing Switch and Switch Lite.\n\nNintendo Switch, meet OLED\n\nNintendo\n\nAs its name suggests, the biggest change to the new Nintendo Switch is its 7-inch OLED display, which is both larger and more advanced than the 6.2 and 5.5-inch LCD screens on the Switch and Switch Lite, respectively.\n\nOLED screens are designed to deliver deeper blacks and more vibrant colors than standard LCD displays, as each pixel is individually controlled. In our testing of various TVs, laptops and phones with OLED, we\u2019ve found these types of screens to deliver a really nice boost in color and contrast. As such, we\u2019re eager to see how titles such as Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild look on the new model.\n\nPlus: Why the Nintendo Switch is still the best console you can buy\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that while the new Switch display uses OLED, it still carries the same 720p resolution as previous versions. So while colors may pop a bit more, you won\u2019t necessarily notice a finer level of detail while exploring Hyrule or jumping around the Mushroom Kingdom.\n\nSome welcome design changes with mostly the same specs\n\nNintendo\n\nA fancy new OLED screen isn\u2019t all the new Nintendo Switch has going for it. The OLED model has a wider adjustable kickstand that spans the entire back of the system and allows for multiple viewing angles, which is a nice step up from the small and somewhat flimsy stand on the base Switch model. There\u2019s also a built-in Ethernet port for those who want to use wired internet for the best possible connection when duking it out online in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate or Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.\n\nThe Switch OLED comes with 64GB of onboard storage for digital game downloads, which is double the 32GB you get on the Switch and Switch Lite. Nintendo also says the Switch OLED features \u201cenhanced audio\u201d compared to the previous models, which is a claim we\u2019re looking forward to testing.\n\nKeep in mind that the Switch OLED has the exact same processor, RAM and general specs as other versions of the system, so you won\u2019t be getting a bump in performance or loading times while playing games. If you\u2019ve been holding your breath for a \u201cNintendo Switch Pro\u201d with 4K output or more overall muscle, you\u2019ll have to keep waiting.\n\nPlus: Forget hunting that Xbox Series X \u2014 why Xbox Game Pass is all you need now\n\nThe latest Switch also comes in a slick new white color scheme, which extends to both the Joy-Con controllers as well as the dock. And if you\u2019d rather keep things basic, you can still get a standard black model with red and blue Joy-Cons.\n\nLet\u2019s recap: Release date, preorders and how the OLED compares\n\nNintendo\n\nAt just $50 more than the current Nintendo Switch, the $349 Switch OLED is shaping up to be the version to get for those that haven\u2019t jumped into the Switch family yet. Aside from featuring a promising OLED screen, it also gets you a more refined design with a better kickstand, a handy Ethernet port and more onboard storage.\n\nIf you only plan on gaming on the go or just want the most portable (and cheapest) Switch out there, the $199 Nintendo Switch Lite is probably best for you. And if you mainly play in TV mode, this new model performs identically to the $299 Nintendo Switch when connected to a display. There\u2019s little reason for existing Switch owners to upgrade here, but those that don\u2019t yet have a Switch will be treated to the most feature-packed version of the system yet.\n\nNintendo Switch OLED with White Joy-Con ($349.99; bestbuy.com or gamestop.com\n\nNintendo Switch OLED with Neon Joy-Con ($349.99; bestbuy.com or gamestop.com\n\nThe Switch OLED is set to arrive Oct. 8, and we expect preorders to open soon at the links above.
