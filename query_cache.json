Pritzker, a Democrat, called out DeSantis as an \u201cextremist.\u201d\n\nIn DeSantis\u2019 view, banning a Black history course will make him more popular. In the November ruling addressing public universities and colleges, the judge slammed the law by quoting the first sentence of 1984, George Orwell\u2019s famous novel about life under a totalitarian government: \u201c\u2018It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen,\u2019 and the powers in charge of Florida\u2019s public university system have declared the State has unfettered authority to muzzle its professors in the name of \u2018freedom.\u2019\u201d The judge added, \u201cThis is positively dystopian.\u201d\n\nThe \"Stop WOKE\" law was part of the national GOP\u2019s war on what they dubbed \u201ccritical race theory\u201d (\u201cCRT\u201d) designed to curtail, and even ban, discussions on race in schools. Republicans, however, are now 30 points more likely to say schools should teach less black history.\u201d\n\nFor that analysis, Tesler also cited a February 2018 poll which found that a third of people who\u2019d voted for Donald Trump in 2016 believed \u201cAmerican children should solely be taught about Western civilization and European / US History.\u201d\n\nRepublican voters\u2019 hostility to teaching Black history in school did not happen overnight but has been building over the past two decades. She found that 73% of those who voted for Trump in 2020 believe \u201ctoday discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities.\u201d\n\nThis rise of perceived white victimhood in the GOP helps explain why DeSantis is publicly defending the ban on the AP African American studies course, claiming that somehow the course \u201cis somebody pushing an agenda on our kids.\u201d Don\u2019t be surprised if we soon learn of Republicans pushing to ban all Black history from being taught in schools. As Democratic Florida State Sen. Shevrin \u201cShev\u201d Jones powerfully put it in opposing DeSantis efforts to erase Black history: \u201cWe have the potential of raising an entire generation of Black children who will not be able to see themselves represented in their own state or in their education.\u201d\n\nFor DeSantis, the stakes are equally real as he eyes a 2024 run for president.", "liberal", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-01/230130-ron-desantis-jm-1629-25ac54.jpg"], "breitbart-news": ["https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/01/30/donald-trump-ron-desantis-his-donors-are-globalists/", "Donald Trump: Ron DeSantis and His Donors Are Globalists", " \u201cThe Club For No Growth is a GLOBALIST group that I have been taking to the cleaners for years,\u201d Trump wrote in a TruthSocial update, explaining that he worked with the group for a period of time but adding it \u201ccouldn\u2019t get away from China, Europe, Asia, and part\u2019s unknown.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey know I won\u2019t play that game, I am America First all the way.
