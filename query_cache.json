The feature originally launched in June 2019 and covered roughly 200 cities globally, using user-reported data similar to Waze to discover and predict overcrowded trains and buses. Google is expanding that 200-city initial rollout to (eventually) over 10,000 transit agencies in 100 countries, according to today's announcement.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Google Maps' mass transit predictions don't just rely on direct user-reported data. They utilize AI models trained on that data.\n\n\"We apply world-class anonymization technology and differential privacy techniques to Location History Data to make sure your data remains private and secure,\" the announcement declares\u2014although we must point out that attempts to anonymize location data frequently fail.\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle says its mass transit crowd reporting lets users know whether their transit line is likely to \"have lots of open seats, hit full capacity, or be anywhere or in between,\" letting users make a more informed decision about whether to \"hop on board or wait for another train.\" In New York and Sydney, the program is piloting even deeper information, offering live crowdedness information \"right down to the transit car level.\" Today's announcement also notes that across the USA, mass transit is less crowded after morning rush hour and prior to evening rush hour\u2014information unlikely to surprise anyone who uses mass transit regularly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaps is also upgrading its Timeline feature to include mass transit travel history, letting users know how much time they've spent and distance they've traveled via mass transit, walking, driving, and more. If you don't like that feature\u2014or don't trust Google's \"world-class anonymization technology\"\u2014you can disable your Android device's Location History entirely. (Disabling Location History will have a significant impact on ride-share, weather, and mapping apps, among others\u2014and it may render some entirely unusable.)", "centrist", "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-1228418167-760x380.jpg"], "techradar": ["https://www.techradar.com/news/microsofts-new-collaboration-tool-wants-to-replace-google-workspace-for-good", "Microsoft's new collaboration tool wants to replace Google Workspace for good", " Here are the best video conferencing services around\n\nThese are the best productivity tools on the market\n\nAlso check out our roundup of the best free office software\n\nProject Moca\n\nFollowing a successful trial and beta period, Microsoft has now confirmed that Project Moca will be rolling out to users in July 2021 as part of the new board view on Outlook.", "centrist", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iUgP53ugxxnPUSpVG4thcn-1200-80.jpg"], "engadget": ["https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-features-post-lockdown-life-100004041.html", "Google Maps' new features are designed to help you navigate life after lockdown", "Google has introduced a few Maps features that could help you ease back into the world, now that COVID-19 vaccines are available. One of the most useful changes to Maps is the expansion of transit crowdedness predictions to over 10,000 cities in 100 countries.\n\nCompanies are expecting their staff to get back to the office in the near future, and crowdedness prediction can let you know if the train or bus line you're waiting for has a lot of open seats, or if it's already crowded. That way, you can decide whether to hop on or wait for the next one in hopes that it isn't as jam-packed. Maps can make predictions by combining AI tech with contributions from people using Google Maps, along with historical location trends.\n\nGoogle\n\nIf you're in New York and Sydney, you can even see a train's level of crowdedness down to transit car level in real time. Maps will mark the least crowded cars, so you can line up for one of them, thanks to data from transport agencies in the areas. It's still a pilot at the moment, but Google says the feature will be available in more cities soon.\n\nIn addition, the tech giant has launched a new Timeline Insights tab for the Maps app. So long as you're on Android and you have Location History switched on, you'll be able to view \"monthly trends about how you\u2019re navigating the world.\" For instance, that's where you can see how much time you spend at different places, such as shops or airports, and the distance and time for each mode of transportation you've taken. The tech giant says it developed the feature after users told the company that they want \"to be more intentional about how they spend their time\" after living through the pandemic.\n\nFinally, Trips in the Timeline tab is now available to everyone on Android, so you can relive the vacations you've had in the past. In case your favorite travel destination still isn't welcoming tourists, you can go to the section and virtually visit hotels, restaurants and other places you've previously enjoyed.", "centrist", "https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-03/7c707a70-6914-11ea-bbc2-8ad1adea04d7"]}, {"ars-technica": ["positive", 0.583144], "techradar": ["positive", 0.898604], "engadget": ["positive", 0.886225]}, 1, 1626914493.4904718], ["pelosi committee", {"breitbart-news": ["https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2021/07/25/pelosi-my-plan-is-to-appoint-rep-kinzinger-to-the-january-6-select-committee/", "Pelosi: \u2018My Plan\u2019 Is to Appoint Rep.
