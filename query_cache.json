In a press release detailing its investigation, the Autorit\u00e9 said Google sought to unilaterally impose its global news licensing product, aka \u2018Showcase\u2019, under a partnership the tech giant calls Publisher Curated News \u2014 in negotiations with publishers \u2014 pushing for the legal neighbouring right to be incorporated as \u201can ancillary component with no separate financial valuation\u201d. It also found the tech giant sought to exclude press agencies from renumeration related to their content when used by third party publishers \u2014 highlighting that as another breach of its April 2020 decision, by further noting: \u201cThe French legislator has been very explicit on the need to include press agencies.\u201d\n\nIn another finding, it said Google had only provided publishers with \u201cpartial\u201d and \u201cinsufficient\u201d information for a \u201ctransparency assessment of renumeration due\u201d; and further accused the tech giant of delaying until just a few days before the injunction deadline to provide it \u2014 so of being \u201clate\u201d too. The authority\u2019s investigation highlights compliance problems with another injunction \u2014 related to an obligation of neutrality in how protected content is presented on Google\u2019s platforms \u2014 with the watchdog writing on that: \u201cThe strategy put in place by Google has thus strongly encouraged publishers to accept the contractual conditions of the Showcase service and to renounce negotiations relating specifically to the current uses of protected content, which was the subject of the Injunctions, under penalty of seeing their exposure and their remuneration degraded compared to their competitors who would have accepted the proposed terms. Google has, the authority asserts, sought to use a global strategy to close down publishers\u2019 ability to negotiate for remuneration for their content reuse at a national level \u2014 using its Showcase product as a cloak for \u201cavoiding or limiting as much as possible\u201d payments to publishers; and, simultaneously, seeking to use negotiations on neighboring rights as an opportunity to obtain access to new content by press publishers that could allow it to collect additional income, such as from subscriptions to press titles. \u201cOur objective remains the same: We want to turn the page with a definitive agreement,\u201d it added, saying it would take the French Competition Authority\u2019s \u201cfeedback into consideration and adapt our offers\u201d and that: \u201cWe are already engaging with press publishers and agencies beyond IPG, by covering publications that are recognised by the CPPAP as \u2018online press services\u2019, and we reiterate our offer to have an independent third party in a position to evaluate our offers and allow us to base our discussions on facts.\u201d\n\nOther major fines for Google in France in recent years include the aforementioned $268M for adtech abuses last month; $120 for dropping tracking cookies without consent back in December; $166M in December 2019 for opaque and inconsistent ad rules; and $57M for privacy violations in January 2019.", "centrist", "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/524861124.jpg?w=600"]}, {"techradar": ["negative", 0.701959], "ars-technica": ["negative", 0.839546], "engadget": ["positive", 0.778491], "the-next-web": ["positive", 0.661439], "techcrunch": ["negative", 0.863506]}, 1, 1626384888.1927192]]
