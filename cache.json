As of the time of this article\u2019s publishing, if you navigate to Google News and type \u201cartificial intelligence queer\u201d into the search box and then hit enter, you should be introduced to a lot of my work. Using Incognito Mode, Google News returns 120 results for \u201cartificial intelligence queer,\u201d of which 37 are stories that I wrote. Here\u2019s what that means: my journalism represents approximately 30% of the Google News search results for \u201cartificial intelligence queer,\u201d even though only 24% of my listed articles are about anything queer-related. It turns out, when he searches for \u201cartificial intelligence Arsenal,\u201d more of his stories surfaced than when he just searched for \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d But only a few of Tom\u2019s pieces made the list either way. When I search for my pieces there\u2019s a huge difference between just searching for \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d (only one result) and \u201cartificial intelligence queer\u201d (37 results). If I search for \u201cAI queer\u201d the number of my articles that surfaces drops to 21, but if I search for \u201cartificial intelligence pronouns\u201d it leaps to 44 out of 120. In fact, if I substitute \u201cmachine learning\u201d for \u201cartificial intelligence,\u201d a term I don\u2019t use at all in my profile, it surfaces zero results on its own and 27 results with \u201cqueer\u201d added. Slapping some pronouns in my bio and having the privilege of working for a company that enthusiastically supports my reporting on queer issues shouldn\u2019t give me a lion\u2019s share of the results for something as broadly reported on as the search phrase \u201cartificial intelligence queer.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous how many unrelated articles, written by me, you have to scroll before getting to something relevant.

And it does a disservice to both the queer and artificial intelligence communities when the algorithm surfaces my unrelated writings on, for example, quantum physics and Facebook when someone searches for \u201cAI queer,\u201d instead of important stories from reporters about LGBTQPIA+ issues in the STEM sectors."], "wired": ["Google Hopes AI Can Turn Search Into a Conversation", ""]}, {"bbc-news": "center", "cnn": "liberal", "fox-news": "conservative", "abc-news": "liberal", "breitbart-news": "conservative", "axios": "center", "the-hill": "center", "the-washington-post": "liberal"}, {"ars-technica": "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/google-will-pay-268m-revamp-ad-platform-to-settle-antitrust-claims/", "engadget": "https://www.engadget.com/google-ends-support-augmented-reality-measure-app-075038678.html", "hacker-news": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27379083", "recode": null, "techcrunch": "http://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/google-announces-epyc-based-tau-virtual-machines-for-cloud/", "techradar": "https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-use-google-lens-on-your-iphone-or-ipad", "the-next-web": "https://thenextweb.com/news/google-news-queer-ai-journalist", "wired": "https://www.wired.com/story/google-hopes-ai-turn-search-conversation/"}, 7, 1624420372.339201], ["", ["bbc-news", "cnn", "fox-news", "abc-news", "breitbart-news", "axios", "the-hill", "the-washington-post"], {"bbc-news": ["Republicans block 9/11-style congressional probe of Capitol riot", ""], "cnn": ["Opinion: Democrats, act now to protect US democracy from death spiral", " JUST WATCHED Joe Manchin plays monkey wrench to Democrats' plans Replay More Videos ...
