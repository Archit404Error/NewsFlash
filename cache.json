Porzingis attended a strip club last Sunday following Dallas' Game 1 win over the Los Angeles Clippers, and NBA rules prohibit players from going into a \"bar, club, lounge or similar establishment, regardless of player's vaccination status.\" Similar to Porzingis, James' attendance was a violation of the league's health and safety protocol. Not only does the way the league handled the two player violations raise more questions, it also shines a brighter spotlight on how the NBA's health and safety protocols aren't necessarily aligned with the changing protocols in various NBA cities. For Porzingis, whom ESPN's Tim MacMahon reported is fully vaccinated, he would still be in violation of the league's health and safety protocol at a time when cities are relaxing restrictions for those who are fully vaccinated and federal guidelines are changing quickly. There are several factors still unknown about James' attendance at the outdoor event and those individuals at the strip club when Porzingis was there, complicating determining whether either player violated local guidelines as they relate to outdoor gatherings or indoor bars/clubs in Los Angeles.", "four-four-two": "", "nfl-news": "", "nhl-news": "", "talksport": "", "the-sport-bible": "", "bbc-sport": ""}, {"bbc-news": "center", "cnn": "liberal", "fox-news": "conservative", "abc-news": "liberal", "breitbart-news": "conservative", "axios": "center", "the-hill": "center", "the-washington-post": "liberal"}, {"espn": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/tulsa-massacre-documentaries-offer-deep-dive-tragedy-77986783", "bleacher-report": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2943818-is-lebron-james-getting-preferential-treatment-with-nbas-covid-protocols", "four-four-two": null, "nfl-news": null, "nhl-news": null, "talksport": null, "the-sport-bible": null, "bbc-sport": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/basketball/57361225"}], ["Google", ["ars-technica", "engadget", "hacker-news", "recode", "techcrunch", "techradar", "the-next-web", "wired"], {"ars-technica": " \u201cThe AdX platform is only partially interoperable with DFP\u2019s competing ad servers and does not allow the latter to organize a competition between AdX and its competitors\u2014even though AdX itself has a privileged access to a significant portion of advertisers\u2019 demand and while all of these competitors have adopted standards allowing for fairer competition,\u201d the authority said.", "engadget": "", "hacker-news": " The specific example that pushed me over the edge to write this was searching for a news article I know exists on Battlefield 1 sales numbers, instead google's showing me the standard stuff (wiki articles that don't have what I'm looking for) and telling me about battlefield V or the new battlefield that's about to release.", "recode": "", "techcrunch": " \u201cCustomers across every industry are dealing with more demanding and data-intensive workloads and looking for strategic ways to speed up performance and reduce costs,\u201d Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said in a press release. \u201cOur work with key strategic partners like AMD has allowed us to broaden our offerings and deliver customers the best price performance for compute-heavy, business-critical applications\u2013 all on the cleanest cloud in the industry.\u201d\n\nGoogle has already signed up some high-profile customers for an early trial, including Twitter, Snap and DoIT.", "techradar": " Whether you want to translate text, identify plants or find answers to equations, Google Lens is an incredibly useful image recognition tool \u2013 and it\u2019s really easy to install and use on an iOS device.

As of the time of this article\u2019s publishing, if you navigate to Google News and type \u201cartificial intelligence queer\u201d into the search box and then hit enter, you should be introduced to a lot of my work.

Slapping some pronouns in my bio and having the privilege of working for a company that enthusiastically supports my reporting on queer issues shouldn\u2019t give me a lion\u2019s share of the results for something as broadly reported on as the search phrase \u201cartificial intelligence queer.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous how many unrelated articles, written by me, you have to scroll before getting to something relevant.
