# Newsflash
## What it does
Newsflash is a program built to enable people to quickly read up on current news,
all while getting multiple viewpoints from across the aisle. Newsflash pulls
the most recent news from a given topic, summarizes the articles, and displays articles
from several sources with different viewpoints to the user. In other words,
users no longer have to seek out different opinions manually in order to eliminate bias
from the news they are getting.

## Usage
The following command will start the flask server
```bash
usage: python3 main.py
```
Upon starting the server, the program will begin running at `localhost:5000/`
