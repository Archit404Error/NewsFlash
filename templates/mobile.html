        <h3 style = "color: #2d6ff4">Newsflash takes the bias out of news.</h3>
        <h3 style = "color: #2d6ff4">Nowadays it seems impossible to get the acutal <i>news</i>, especially considering all the bias in the sources we read. Newsflash enables you to see whats real and whats not through the power of artificial intelligence, performing sentiment and bias analyses, as well as summarization, on news articles all across the internet.</h3>
        <h3 style = "color: #2d6ff4">We believe that reading the news should be easy and effortless, not some sort of critical thinking exercise where you try and decipher the truth. Download our app to revolutionize your news reading experience!</h3>
